## What is the name of the company a reference to?

The name of the company is a reference to concept in type theory. Informally
speaking, if a type describes a shape of values, then an inhabited type is a
type for which there is a value that conforms to its shape. In theorem proving
systems such as Coq, Idris, et al. a theorem describes a type, and a proof of a
theorem is a term in the language that has the type. So a theorem in these
sorts of systems is an example of an inhabited type.

## What were you thinking when you designed the logo?

The logo is a modified [turnstile][] (&#8866;). It's a symbol that's used in
proof theories to mean "logically entails". The turnstile, together with
additional block below its arm, represents the initials of the company name:
IT. The stem of the turnstile forms the I, and the arm of the turnstile with
the additional block form the T.

The stem of the T is detached from the arms to preserve turnstile, as well as
to make it not look like just a blob of right angles.
